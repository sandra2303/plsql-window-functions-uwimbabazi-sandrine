## ðŸ“Œ Problem Definition
A supermarket chain operating in multiple regions records daily sales transactions.  
The management wants to analyze customer behavior and product performance to improve marketing and inventory decisions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify top products in each region/quarter.
- Track sales growth trends month by month.
- Segment customers into quartiles for targeted marketing.
- Calculate running totals and moving averages.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
1. **Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter** â†’ `RANK()`  
2. **Running Monthly Sales Totals** â†’ `SUM() OVER()`  
3. **Month-over-Month Growth** â†’ `LAG(), LEAD()`  
4. **Customer Quartiles** â†’ `NTILE(4)`  
5. **3-Month Moving Averages** â†’ `AVG() OVER()`  

---

## ðŸ—‚ Database Schema
Three tables were created:  
- **Customers** (`customer_id`, `name`, `region`)  
- **Products** (`product_id`, `name`, `category`)  
- **Transactions** (`transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `sale_date`, `amount`)

## ðŸ–¼  Table Creation & Records (Screenshots)

- Customers table created
**Query:**
```sql
   CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    region VARCHAR2(50)
);
```

---

- Products table created
**Query:**
```sql
  CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,

### ðŸ“¥ Data Insertion
- Records inserted into Customers and products
**Query:**
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, region) VALUES (1001, 'Tonny Claire', 'Kigali');
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, region) VALUES (1002, 'Mbabazi Sandra', 'Huye');
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, region) VALUES (1003, 'Uwera Ange', 'Musanze');
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, region) VALUES (1004, 'Uwase Ritha', 'Kigali');
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, region) VALUES (1005, 'Manzi Chris', 'Huye');


-- Insert sample products
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, category) VALUES (2001, 'Coffee Beans', 'Beverages');
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, category) VALUES (2002, 'Tea Pack', 'Beverages');
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, category) VALUES (2003, 'Bread', 'Bakery');
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, category) VALUES (2004, 'Sugar', 'Grocery');
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, category) VALUES (2005, 'Cooking Oil', 'Grocery');
```
